# Branching Strategy & Deployment

This repository uses a Git Flow-inspired branching strategy with automated CI/CD pipelines.

**Important**: All deployments happen automatically via GitHub Actions based on which branch you push to. You should never need to manually switch Azure environments locally.

## Branch Structure

### `develop` â†’ Test Environment
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for ongoing development
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to Azure test environment on every push via GitHub Actions
- **Azure Environment**: `test` 
- **Resource Group**: `rg-website-test`
- **URL**: https://app-rixoirdj4a3x6.azurewebsites.net
- **Testing**: All feature work is merged here first for integration testing
- **Local Work**: This is your default branch for development

### `main` â†’ Production Environment  
- **Purpose**: Stable production-ready code
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to Azure production environment on every push/merge via GitHub Actions
- **Azure Environment**: `prod`
- **Resource Group**: `rg-website-prod`
- **URL**: https://app-p3ekdbppge5hk.azurewebsites.net
- **Updates**: Only receives code via PR/merge from `develop` branch
- **Local Work**: You typically don't work on this branch directly

### `feature/*` branches
- **Purpose**: Individual feature development
- **Deployment**: No automatic deployments - test locally only
- **Testing**: Test locally using `npm run dev` and `npm run build`
- **Workflow**: Create from `develop`, merge back to `develop` when complete
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/hero-animation` or `feature/contact-form`

## Workflow

**Golden Rule**: Never commit directly to `develop` or `main`. Always work on feature branches.

### Starting new work
```bash
# Switch to develop and make sure it's up to date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch with descriptive name
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Examples: feature/hero-section, feature/contact-form, feature/performance-optimization

# Work on your feature...
# Test locally with: npm run dev
# Build locally with: npm run build
```

### Testing your feature locally
```bash
# Run development server (with hot reload)
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000

# Test production build locally
npm run build
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Deploying to test environment
```bash
# Commit your changes on the feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"

# Push feature branch to GitHub (optional, for backup or collaboration)
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Switch to develop and merge your feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop  # Make sure develop is up to date
git merge feature/your-feature-name

# Push to develop - this triggers automatic deployment to TEST
git push origin develop
# âœ… GitHub Actions automatically deploys to https://app-rixoirdj4a3x6.azurewebsites.net

# Wait a few minutes and test your changes on the test site
```

### Promoting to production
```bash
# After testing thoroughly on test environment:

# Switch to main and merge develop
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge develop

# Push to main - this triggers automatic deployment to PRODUCTION
git push origin main
# âœ… GitHub Actions automatically deploys to https://app-p3ekdbppge5hk.azurewebsites.net

# Optional: Create a GitHub release tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## GitHub Actions Variables

The workflow automatically selects the correct Azure environment based on the branch. These repository variables are configured in GitHub Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions â†’ Variables:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Service principal client ID (shared across environments)
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Azure AD tenant ID (shared across environments)
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Azure subscription ID (shared across environments)
- `AZURE_ENV_NAME_TEST`: Name of test environment (`test`)
- `AZURE_ENV_NAME_PROD`: Name of production environment (`prod`)
- `AZURE_LOCATION`: Azure region (e.g., `switzerlandnorth`)

**You don't need to change these** - they're already configured and working.

## Local Azure Environment (Advanced - Rarely Needed)

Your local `azd` environment should always be set to `test`. You almost never need to switch this.

```bash
# Check current environment
azd env list

# If needed, switch to test (should already be default)
azd env select test
```

**When would you use local azd commands?**
- ðŸš« **Almost never** - GitHub Actions handles all deployments
- âœ… **Only if** you need to manually test infrastructure changes before pushing
- âœ… **Only if** you need to debug deployment issues locally

**Normal workflow**: Just push to branches, let GitHub Actions do the deployment.

## Branch Protection Rules (Recommended)

Configure in GitHub Settings â†’ Branches:

### `main` branch
- âœ… Require pull request before merging
- âœ… Require approvals (at least 1)
- âœ… Require status checks to pass
- âœ… Do not allow bypassing

### `develop` branch  
- âœ… Require pull request before merging (optional)
- âœ… Require status checks to pass

## Local Development

**This is where you spend 99% of your time.** No deployments happen on feature branches - test everything locally first:

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only, or after package.json changes)
npm install

# Run development server with hot reload
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Changes auto-reload as you edit files

# Test production build locally (before pushing to develop)
npm run build
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000

# Lint your code
npm run lint
```

**Development workflow**:
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and test with `npm run dev`
3. Build locally to verify: `npm run build`
4. If build succeeds, commit and merge to `develop`
5. GitHub Actions deploys to test environment
6. Test on https://app-rixoirdj4a3x6.azurewebsites.net
7. If working, merge `develop` to `main` for production

## Environments Summary

| Environment | Branch | URL | Deploy Method | When to Use |
|------------|--------|-----|---------------|-------------|
| **Local Dev** | `feature/*` | http://localhost:3000 | `npm run dev` | Daily development & testing |
| **Test** | `develop` | https://app-rixoirdj4a3x6.azurewebsites.net | GitHub Actions | Integration testing |
| **Production** | `main` | https://app-p3ekdbppge5hk.azurewebsites.net | GitHub Actions | Live site |

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment failed on develop/main
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for error details
2. Review Azure App Service logs: `az webapp log tail --name <app-name> --resource-group <rg-name>`
3. Verify all GitHub variables are set correctly

### Want to skip deployment
Push to a feature branch instead of develop/main - feature branches don't trigger deployments.

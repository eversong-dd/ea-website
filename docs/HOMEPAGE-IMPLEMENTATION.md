# Homepage Implementation - Eversong AI

## Overview
Built the Eversong AI homepage based on the design brief in `/docs/website-designg-brief.json`, following Swiss-minimalist design principles with McKinsey.com-inspired layout patterns.

## What Was Built

### 1. **Global Styles** (`app/globals.css`)
- Implemented Eversong AI brand colors:
  - Ink Blue: `#001238` (primary)
  - Pearl: `#F1F1F1` (secondary)
- Applied Swiss-minimalist typography with Corbel/Helvetica/Roboto font stack
- Generous whitespace with 6rem section padding
- Light font weights (400) with tight letter-spacing (-0.02em)

### 2. **Navigation Component** (`components/navigation/Navigation.tsx`)
- Fixed top navbar with scroll-based transparency transition
- Transitions from transparent (over hero) to white with shadow (on scroll)
- All navigation items from design brief included
- Discreet "Talk to us" CTA link (underlined, not button)
- Responsive design (desktop navigation shown on lg+)

### 3. **Video Hero Component** (`components/hero/VideoHero.tsx`)
- Full-screen video background with calm, restrained entrance animations
- GSAP timeline with `power2.out` easing (less aggressive than before)
- Proper overlay gradient for text readability
- Headline, subline, and inline CTA link
- Text in Pearl color (#F1F1F1) for contrast against Ink Blue overlay
- Swiss-minimalist typography with light font weights

### 4. **Insight Tiles Component** (`components/home/InsightTiles.tsx`)
- McKinsey-style floating tiles with `-mt-32` overlap below hero
- 4-column grid (responsive: 1 col mobile, 2 on tablet, 4 on desktop)
- Images are **desaturated by default**, full color on hover
- High-contrast text overlay with gradient from Ink Blue
- Gentle elevation and shadow on hover
- Framer Motion scroll-triggered animations with stagger effect
- Graceful fallback gradient for tiles without images

### 5. **Footer Component** (`components/layout/Footer.tsx`)
- 4-column grid with brand, company links, resources, and contact
- Consistent typography with light weights
- Bottom bar with copyright and legal links
- Discreet styling matching overall brand aesthetic

### 6. **Homepage** (`app/page.tsx`)
- Clean, focused layout with just hero and insight tiles
- Ready for the 4 insight tiles specified in design brief:
  1. The AI Deadlock
  2. The Executive Sprint
  3. Case: Powercrumbs
  4. Scaling AI Safely

### 7. **Layout & Metadata** (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Updated site metadata for Eversong AI
- SEO-optimized title and description
- Removed Geist fonts, using system fonts per brand guidelines
- Open Graph tags for social sharing

## Design Principles Applied

✅ **Swiss-minimalist aesthetic** - generous whitespace, light typography  
✅ **Calm authority** - restrained animations, subtle transitions  
✅ **McKinsey.com inspiration** - floating tiles with overlap  
✅ **No icons** - navigation via titles, images, and hyperlinks only  
✅ **Discreet CTAs** - text links with underlines, not heavy buttons  
✅ **Brand colors** - Ink Blue (#001238) and Pearl (#F1F1F1) throughout  
✅ **Premium feel** - high-quality animations, proper spacing  

## What's Missing (To Complete)

### Images Required
See `/public/images/IMAGE-REQUIREMENTS.md` for detailed specifications.

**Must add:**
1. Hero video: `/public/videos/hero-bg.mp4` (calm, slow-motion, abstract)
2. 4 tile images in `/public/images/insights/` and `/public/images/case-studies/`

**Without images:** Tiles will show Ink Blue gradient fallback (still functional)

### Future Pages to Build
Per design brief structure:
- `/about` - About page with two-column layout
- `/services` - Services grid (3 cards, no icons)
- `/ai-executive-sprint` - Sprint offering page
- `/case-studies` - Case studies overview
- `/insights` - Insights/articles list
- `/contact` - Contact form

## Technical Details

- **Build status**: ✅ Successful compilation
- **TypeScript**: No errors
- **Next.js**: 16.0.0 with Turbopack
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design
- **Animations**: GSAP + Framer Motion
- **Performance**: Static generation, optimized

## Next Steps

1. **Add images** - See IMAGE-REQUIREMENTS.md
2. **Test locally** - Run `npm run dev` and view at `localhost:3000`
3. **Build additional pages** - Follow design brief for About, Services, etc.
4. **Deploy** - Test deployment to Azure when ready
